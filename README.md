# NEW-YORK-POLICE-DEPARTMENT-PROJECT - MACHINE LEARING
●Design and Implementation of Analytics System of Big Data Analytics project with Machine Learning and Statistical models results that uses Big and Real Life datasets from The New York Police Department (NYPD)’s Stop, Question and Frisk database by Python, R programming and Rattle.\

Content and purpose:

These data were originally collected by New York Police Department officers and record information gathered as a result of stop question and frisk (SQF) encounters between 2003 and 2018. These data were used in a study carried out, under contract to the New York City Police Foundation, by the Rand Corporation's Center on Quality Policing. This data collection contains information on the officer's reasons for initiating a stop, whether the stop led to a summons or arrest, demographic information for the person stopped, and the suspected criminal behavior. We need to analyze dataset and use statistical to predict on the SQF target to understand that when we can use SQF process to a person or we can use modeling algorithm to review SQF process by police since we may know that wrong action of SQF from police.\

Data Analytics process:
\
       -  Collecting, Combining, Storing, Cleansing, Understanding, Analyzing and Predicting on the Big Dataset around four million rows such as find outliers, missing values, duplicate values, histogram, bar charts, line charts to analyze on the attributes, find relationship on the related as race, age, height, weight, reason of stop, reason of frisked, using weapons, check and analyze criminal problems.\
       - Find Predictor Importance attributes impact directly to the Frisked target.\
       - Building, developing, and maintaining statistical models for whole dataset as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.\
       - Analyzing on 120 attributes and 4,000,000 rows of Criminal problems, Sex, Race, Age, Haircolor, City, Eyecolor Stop, Frisked, Height, Weapons, ect and predicting to Frisked target for the Stop, Question, and Frisked problem by police.\
\
Apply Statistical model and Machine Learning:\
\
      -  Find accuracies, AUC values, ROC curves and using statistical models as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM based on the Frisked target attribute to making decisions for Stop, Question, and Frisked process by police.\
      \
If modeling results have given high AUC values based on the target over 80% then we can make a decision that person will be stop, question or frisked by police
